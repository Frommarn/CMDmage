# CMDmage
Small hobby project for creating a turn-based commandline dungeon crawler as a mage.

## Build
This project targets at least .Net Core 3.0 and should always be possible to build as a single stand-alone executable file. More details on how to build this project will be added later.

## Intent
This project will be updated sporadically when time is available and will probably never reach a fully playable state. Welcome!

## Background
You're playing as a mage in a dungeon. But your interaction with the game is limited to a commandline interface! Now, you have to learn how to control your character by writing commands on the commandline and discover the true secret that lies deep inside this dungeon. On your way you will encounter a range of different foes and discover spell commands which you can combine into all sorts of powerful spells, and hopefully have fun on the way! Welcome to CMDmage!
